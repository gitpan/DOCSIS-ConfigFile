VERSION
    0.6003

SYNOPSIS
        use DOCSIS::ConfigFile;
        use JSON;

        my $obj     = DOCSIS::ConfigFile->new(
                          shared_secret   => '', # default
                          advanced_output => 0,  # default
                      );

                      $obj->shared_secret("foobar");
        my $encoded = $obj->encode([ {...}, {...}, ... ]);
        my $decoded = $obj->decode($filename);
                      $obj->advanced_output(1);
        my $dec_adv = $obj->decode(\$encoded);

        # see simple config in JSON format
        print JSON->new->pretty->decode($decoded);

        # see advanced config in JSON format
        print JSON->new->pretty->decode($dec_adv);

DESCRIPTION
    An instance from this class can be used to encode or decode <DOCSIS>
    (Data over Cable Service Interface Specifications) config files. These
    files are usually served using a TFTP server, after a <cable modem> or
    MTA (Multimedia Terminal Adapter) has recevied an IP address from a DHCP
    server. These files are binary encode using a variety of functions, but
    all the data in the file are constructed by TLVs (type-length-value)
    blocks. These can be nested and concatenated.

    This module is used as a layer between any human readable data and the
    binary structure. The config file in human readable format can look
    something like this:

        [
            { name => NetworkAccess => value => 1 },
            { name => GlobalPrivacyEnable => value => 1 },
            { name => MaxCPE => value => 10 },
            { name => BaselinePrivacy =>
                nested => [
                    { name => AuthTimeout => value => 10 },
                    { name => ReAuthTimeout => value => 10 },
                    { name => AuthGraceTime => value => 600 },
                    { name => OperTimeout => value => 1 },
                    { name => ReKeyTimeout => value => 1 },
                    { name => TEKGraceTime => value => 600 },
                    { name => AuthRejectTimeout => value => 60 },
                    { name => SAMapWaitTimeout => value => 1 },
                    { name => SAMapMaxRetries => value => 4 }
                ]
            },
        ]

    There is also an optional "advanced_output" flag which can include more
    information, but this is what is required/default: An array-ref of
    hash-refs, containing a "name" and a "value" (or "nested" for nested
    data structures). The rest will this module figure out.

FAULT HANDLING
    As for version 0.60, this module has changed from holding errors in an
    attribute to actively reporting errors, using "confess()", "carp()" and
    the module autodie for reporting system errors from "open()" and
    friends. Constructing the object, and changing attribute values are
    still safe to do, but "encode" and "decode" might die.

ATTRIBUTES
  shared_secret
    Sets or gets the shared secret.

  advanced_output
    Sets weither advanced output should be enabled. Takes 0 or 1 as
    argument. Advanced output is off (0) by default.

METHODS
  new
        $self = $class->new(\%args);

    Arguments can be:

     shared_secret   => Shared secret in encoded cm config file
     advanced_output => Advanced decoded config format
     mibs            => will set $ENV{MIBS} to load custom mibs

  decode
        $array_ref = $self->decode($path_to_file);
        $array_ref = $self->decode(\$binary_string);
        $array_ref = $self->decode($FH);

    This method decodes a binary config file stored in either a file on
    disk, a binary string, or a filehandle. It returns an array-ref of
    hashes, containing the config as a perl data structure.

  encode
        $binary_str = $self->encode([ { ... }, ... ]);

    Encodes an array of hashes, containing the DOCSIS config-file settings
    and returns a binary encoded string. See "DESCRIPTION" and the unit
    tests for example input. For other structures, see the table generated
    by "dump_symbol_tree" in DOCSIS::ConfigFile::Syminfo.

CONSTANTS
  Decode
    Returns DOCSIS::ConfigFile::Decode.

  Encode
    Returns DOCSIS::ConfigFile::Encode.

  Syminfo
    Returns DOCSIS::ConfigFile::Syminfo.
